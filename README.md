# Pascals Triangle

This program can clculate every number row in pascals trinagle or it can claculate the entire triangle.

## Description

I created this to help with binomila expantion as you need all the numbers form a specific layer but later i found that calculating the entire triangle created a satisfing pattern for an exponental curve. Whne calculating munch above the 1000th term slows down as the numbers are getting extremly big. As the numbers get very big interesting patterns asn the number format themselves in the console.
